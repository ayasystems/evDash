It is possible to enter two WIFI networks:

wifiSsid=x			set primary AP ssid
wifiPassword=x			set primary AP password
wifiSsid2=x			set backup AP ssid (replace primary wifi automatically in 1-2 minutes)
wifiPassword2=x			set backup AP password

On startup evDash connects to the main wifi.
mainLoop() does take care of wifi. If wifi is enabled and there is no connection for more than 60 seconds it calls wififallback()
When wififallback() is called, it checks whether main or backup wifi was active last time. It tries to connect to the other.
If only main wifi is configured it allways tries to connect to this.

There is no need for netSendData() to take care of wifi. It is removed.

If you want to delete the second Wifi again, because you only want to use one, you have to enter:

wifiSsid2=empty

Don't forget to save:

saveSettings
reboot
